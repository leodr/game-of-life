    <strong>Conway's Game of Life in React</strong>
</p>

<br><br>

The [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), also
known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British
mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its
initial state, requiring no further input.

This is a web implementation of Conway's Game of Life using React, Next.js and
CSS modules.
